    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Proactive Diary</p>

    <h2>Your Data Stays on Your Device</h2>
    <p>Proactive Diary is a private daily writing practice app. All diary entries, goals, and settings are stored locally on your device. We never collect, transmit, read, or analyze what you write. Your words are yours alone.</p>

    <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect any personal diary content, entry text, titles, moods, tags, or goals. None of your writing ever leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Network Connections</h2>
    <p>The app makes network connections only for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> To manage subscription purchases (monthly, annual, or lifetime plans). This is handled entirely by the Google Play Billing Library and Google's servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> We collect anonymous, aggregated usage analytics (such as which screens are visited and which features are used) to improve the app experience. No diary content is included in analytics data.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> If you choose to sign in (optional), your email address is stored by Firebase for account management only.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> Anonymous crash reports are collected to identify and fix bugs. These reports contain device information and stack traces but never diary content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data You Can Export</h2>
    <p>You can export all your diary entries at any time in JSON or plain text format via Settings > Export Writing. You can also generate a PDF book of your year's writing.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can permanently delete all your data at any time via Settings > Delete All Data. This action is irreversible and removes all entries, goals, reminders, and preferences from your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> For billing and in-app purchases. Subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> For anonymous analytics, optional authentication, and crash reporting. Subject to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@proactivediary.com">support@proactivediary.com</a>.</p>
